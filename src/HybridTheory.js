        When someone or a state makes an <strong>Expression of Peace</strong>,
        it means that stakeholder not excluding any other people or state on
        peacemaking.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        This is a mindset, that is un(variable|conditional), hence constant-like and takes a high level
        of generosity and the least need for caution; which results an acceptance of one big humanity, and an
        attitude and a feeling of living a world residency.
      </p>
      <p style={{textAlign:"left", marginLeft: "10%", marginRight:"10%"}}>
        When a stakeholder finds an expression "peaceful", it's an{" "}
        <strong>Acknowledgement of Peace</strong>. Through those peer to peer
        interactions, bilateral and multilateral, so called "mini-pacts of
        peace" can cherish.
        <br></br>
        Through observations those, we'd love to realise meaningful, intentional
        and international bonds between stakeholders with the least effort.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        This very part, will provide the time and rethinking the rigid nature of
        "enemy/ally" structures, that'll hopefully be obsolete, and a unity would
        emerge by an observability aroud the accumulation of will and
        intentions, of people and other stakeholders.

        <strong>Attestations of Peace</strong>, is planned to be another
        component of the dynamics of a World Peace, relating to quality
        (peacefulness) and quantity (verifications) of interactions.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        If ever requested, attestations will help us to promote peaceful and
        verified expressions and acknowledgements. This is also how we are going
        to provide the high level of

      <p style={{textAlign:"left", marginLeft: "10%", marginRight:"10%"}}>
        <strong>Recognitions of Peace</strong> are going to have conditionals,
        at least for the interactions to happen between the states in the
        Charter of the United Nations.
        
        <br></br> <br></br> We will be (only) imagining and designing a solution for that; which being
        an escrow system and mediation framework, including states, corporations
        operating in the defense sector. 
        <br></br>        <br></br>

        Basically, people will be rewarding states and such corporations and investors with $respect, as they express and intend to seal when their conditionals are satisfied. Otherwise, funds they deposit to get into the escrow, would be transferred to a global fund of regeneration. 
        <br></br> <br></br>
        On this part, we're only caring about how states will recognize the
        expressions and acknowledgements of people worldwide, and reflect
        humanity via their expressed intentions to seal a World Peace as its
        final stakeholders.
