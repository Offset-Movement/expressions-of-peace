      <p>
        When anyone makes an <strong>Expression of Peace</strong>, it means that
        person do not exclude any country on peacemaking. People are not
        enemies, it's historical events caused by violent terms, resulting anger
        and sustained, resulting to that. This is a mindset, that's
        unconditional, and takes generosity that is an acceptance of one
        humanity, and a manner and feeling of living a world residency.
      </p>
      <p>
        When someone finds an expression of someone else "peaceful", it's an{" "}
        <strong>Acknowledgement of Peace</strong>. Those are more have to do
        with peer to peer interactions, that are potentially build bilateral and
        multilateral, individual mini-pacts of peace. Through observations
        those, we'd love to build meaningful, intentional and international
        bonds with least effort. This, along with
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <strong>Attestations of Peace</strong>, will be casting the foundations
        of the dynamics, that are to do with quality (peacefulness) and quantity
        (verifications) of interactions. For the sake of its legitimate stance,
        if ever requested, we're including attestations that'll cover that part.
        It's also how we are going to increase the cognitive security in the
        system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Different from using of the Peace by Equality notion and right with
        Expressions and Acknowledgements of Peace;{" "}
        <strong>Recognitions of Peace</strong> are going to have conditionals,
        at least for the interactions to happen between the states in the
        Charter of the United Nations.
