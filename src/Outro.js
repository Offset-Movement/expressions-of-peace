      What we have been observing so far: the ones opts-in and out of peace
      treaties, traditionally and naturally, by delegation or inheritance of power, have been
      the ones with highest capacity of violence, whether they use it or not in an offensive manner. <br></br>
      <br></br> However the majority impacted by conflicts, have no significant
      labor, direct impact, hence legitimacy in the making and sustaining a world
      peace.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>

      
      <strong>It is time to separate power and violence</strong>, in fact, search power somewhere
      else: in the conscience and wisdom of a great civilization: Humanity.
