        <strong>is all about standing equal in peace and trust making: </strong> namingly, a World Peace by Equality.
        <br></br> <br></br>
        Historically, we have been observing this: parties opts-in and out of peace
        treaties; traditionally and naturally, by delegation or inheritance of
        power, have been the ones with highest capacity of violence, whether
        they use it or not in an offensive manner, or even if not use at all. <br></br>
        <br></br> However, citizens, the majority impacted by conflicts, have no
        direct impact, significant labor, hence any observable legitimacy in the making and
        sustaining a world peace. 
        <br></br>        <br></br>

        With peace-oriented diplomacy, we'd like to give that power to people, and that's individual sovereignty in the context of being a co-signer of a World Peace treaty.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <strong>It is time to separate power and violence</strong>, in fact,
        search power somewhere else: in the conscience and wisdom of a great
        civilization: <strong>Humanity</strong>.
