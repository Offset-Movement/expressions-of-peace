              That's why we'd like this whole process to be treated, perceived
              and implemented as a global petition,{" "}
            </strong>{" "}
            where people, in essence, proactively encouraging and empowering
            their respective states to reflect and align with their wishes and
            provide a sustainable security.
            <br></br>

            This time, with a shield of an ultimate peace, rather than war
            machines,{" "}
            <strong>
              {" "}
              <i> first time in the history</i>.

            In the making of a World Peace, via experiencing of an emerging
            human right, it would be a fallacy to make it a money game.

            expressions and acknowledgements will never have a cost or
            over-requested data.
