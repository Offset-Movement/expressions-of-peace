**going multi-page and multi-lang**

On this document, we will be articulating on how to enhance the https://expressionsofpeace.org homepage UI and UX with rich content, without futher ado @ improvements on the decentralized app/dapp connected to the homepage.

Currently, it is a one-page, quite texty page, without much of visual illustration on the interactions between participants/stakeholders of multiple kinds. 

Let's make the homepage less texty and better UX-wise, to get people into the dapp.

Here will include a structure and partially, content starting with what resides on the navbar, some having their own pages, and some reside as sections on the homepage. 

As-is, each are page, sections (scroll down to..) would be part of the next iteration.

>> Left-most, Peace logo, or written Expressions of Peace/Peace by Equality/Art of Peace (maybe in a scheduled to change from time to time )
