// Previously, we've deployed an Expression of Peace (EoP) contract, and as of its V2, 
// introduced the inclusion of citizenship info (country ISO code) along with the expression text.

// Now, in this, first version of the acknowledgements, we'll basically refer to those transaction hashes.
// Exclusion of the wallet address made that expression will require fetching their account address from tx history of EoP contract.
// since in any case we'll lookup tx history through an EoP contract or a wallet's history of interaction with these contracts, 
// Will be a headache until we index all potentially via, thegraph or another solution. 

// There may and probably exist a better solutions for this as-is, so.. 
// ~ Expect a new version during the Q4'2022.
